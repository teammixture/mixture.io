      <h4>Mixture.</h4>
      <p>Last year we announced that we had removed pricing and Mixture had become a free download, but we would no longer be actively developing the project &mdash; we made these decisions because it was no longer financially viable for us to continue.</p>
      <p>Users have continued to use the product and raise support questions, but our time is limited and we have been unable to answer every question. The technologies behind Mixture have begun to move on and we have been unable to update the product in line with these changes.</p>
      <p>The time has come for us to turn off the download and recommend that users investigate alternatives, we highly recommend you try <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> or <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a></p>
      <p>We're really grateful to all of our users for using and supporting Mixture and only wish it could have grown into a more sustainable product.</p>
